Create your own branch (Your userid) and push your refactoring changes 

Greg's Comments.

Hey Vlad,
Well done - I like the idea of the MoveDirection. I might investigate it further in my code. 

I have put in some minor changes. Each commit was an individual refactor and I think that it will make sense to you as well.
Thanks for taking the course again.
